            <p>
              We live and die by our results. We never work on activities just
              for the sake of activity. And we don’t bill for busy work. We are
              driven by measurable results because we don’t have to guess at
              what really works. While many SEO agencies are rehashing outdated
              tactics that actually hurt site rankings, preaching impotent ideas
              like “you need to blog more”, we bring power and purpose to our
              SEO activities. As a result,{" "}
