It&#8217;s a topic I&#8217;ve been pondering for a while now.</p>\n<p>Where is SEO and PPC headed and could 1+1=3? That&#8217;s a question posed frequently by people who do both SEO and PPC wondering if the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>Ok for the non-skimmers&#8230;I don&#8217;t mean that Google is going to give some favoritism to someone who runs ads. I mean that many of the aspects that it takes to get better results in each field are increasingly similar.</p>\n<p>It used to be that PPC was quality score driven and then a manager had to continually refine negative keyword lists until it was finely tuned. Google&#8217;s been systematically dismantling that for the last two years with changes to match types and how negative keywords work.</p>\n<p>SEO is increasingly focused now on &#8220;experience&#8221; which was customarily thought to be more of the kind of thing you considered for quality scores in PPC.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s already the case now (in my opinion) that PPC does better (generally) when traffic is run to well-optimized website pages (from an SEO perspective).</p>\n<p>My working hypothesis is that Google cares most about customer experience. If that&#8217;s the case, to them traffic is traffic. Why would they make a distinction between a searcher who clicks an ad or a website link?</p>\n<p>My evidence for this hypothesis would take too long to detail out in this email but I&#8217;ve seen a lot of reasons to think this is the direction Google is headed including the core vitals update recently and much of the developments on the PPC side with AI.</p>\n<p>I really think you&#8217;ll see in the next 2 years a blurring of the line between the two disciplines to where doing one well, will require doing the other well.</p>\n<p>As to Full Coverage SEO I think that if you look at traditional advertising many believe that being top of mind is what wins. Therefore they optimize for impression share.</p>\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it logically follow that if someone is undecided and searching (as evidenced by a keyword search and not a branded search) that Page Impression Share would matter too? I just made that term up just now. I&#8217;m trademarking that too. Page Impression Share™ &lt;&#8212;-first in use! </p>\n<p>Meaning this. Let&#8217;s say someone has seen your ads. They know your brand. Then one day they actually need you, and they search for the thing they need, not your brand.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s pick a random keyword out of the air like&#8230;ohh Personal Injury Lawyer [City].</p>\n<p>If they see you in the LSA&#8217;s and PPC and the Map Box and the Organic&#8230;doesn&#8217;t it stand to reason that there&#8217;s going to be a multiplication effect vs anyone, or just a plurality of those choices?</p>\n<p>Based on this article, and my own experience for the last 10 years in this industry I tend to think that&#8217;s the case.</p>\n<p>For further reading on the synergy, concept check out this article.

In fact I think it&#8217;s greater than just PPC/SEO. I think that if there&#8217;s a spot on google available you should take it so you fully cover the page as much as possible.
